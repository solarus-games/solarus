solarus-1.0.0 (2013-05-03)

The "I love Lua" release.

This is a major release. The version number switches from 0.x to 1.x
because there is a brand new Lua scripting API.
I now consider that Solarus can be used to create your own Zelda-like
games in decent conditions.
By "in decent conditions", I essentially mean: with a clean and stable
scripting API. Clean because there are nice datatypes now and the API is much
easier to use, less error-prone and more with the Lua spirit.
Stable because future versions of the scripting API will now try to keep
compatibility with existing scripts. Any API change that breaks compatibility
will now be clearly documented.

Data files and scripts written for solarus 0.x are not compatible with
solarus 1.x.
Which is not a problem since until now, I never said you could create a quest
in decent conditions :)
More seriously, I guess I'm the only one to have a lot of data files and
scripts created for solarus 0.x.
Anyway, conversion scripts are provided to upgrade your existing data files,
but not your scripts (the scripting API, which was working but ugly and
unstable, has totally changed).

Changes:

* Rewrite the Lua scripting API from scratch. Cleaner, real datatypes, much
easier to use, less error-prone, much more features, fully documentated.
* All scripts now live in a single Lua world.
* Add support of scripted graphics.
* Add support of scripted menus. Menus like the title screen, the savegames
menu, the pause menu and the HUD are no longer hardcoded into the engine.
* Doors, chests, teletransporters and destinations are now much more flexible
and customizable.
* Except tiles, all map entities can now have a name. The name is now optional.
* Change the format of some data files, including maps and tilesets.
* No more ini data files (removed the dependency to SimpleIni).
* Add conversion scripts to upgrade existing data files (but not scripts).
* Fix infinite explosions of bomb flowers.

This version also include changes from 0.9.3, though 0.9.3 is not released
yet:

* The game screen size can now be set at compilation time.
* Change the savegames directory on Mac OS X.
* Improve the support of Mac OS X, Pandora, Caanoo and other platforms.
* Fix the compilation with Visual C++.
* Fix blocks making sometimes only a half move (#33).
* Fix pixel-precise collisions not always correct (#53).
* Fix the end of target movement on slow machines (#34).
* Fix the hero being freezed when using the hookshot on bomb flowers (#119).

Changes in Solarus Quest Editor:

* First release of a working editor.
* Implement creating a new quest.
* Implement edition of project_db.dat through the quest tree view.
* Allow to show a grid on the map editor.
* Fix a lot of bugs.

solarus-0.9.3 (2013-05-08)

This should be the last release of the 0.9 branch.
Existing games must now upgrade to Solarus 1.0.

However, upgrading to Solarus 1.0 represents a lot of work and testing: in the
meantime, this release introduces important fixes that improve the situation
of existing games.

* The game screen size can now be set at compilation time.
* Change the savegames directory on Mac OS X.
* Improve the support of Mac OS X, Pandora, Caanoo and other platforms.
* Images other than 8-bit can now be used for pixel-precise collisions.
* Fix the compilation with Visual C++.
* Fix the compilation of SimpleIni with gcc 4.7.2.
* Fix blocks making sometimes only a half move (#33).
* Fix pixel-precise collisions not always correct (#53).
* Fix the end of target movement on slow machines (#34).
* Fix the hero being freezed when using the hookshot on bomb flowers (#119).

solarus-0.9.2 (2012-04-03)

* Fix a crash using a teletransporter to the same map while an enemy is dying
* Immobilized enemies restarted too early when using a teletransporter

solarus-0.9.1 (2012-02-12)

* The player can now run with the action key if he has the ability "run"
* Fix locked doors and blocks that could consume more than one small key
* Experimental: new syntax of dialog files in Lua that makes parsing, writing
and translating dialogs easier (a conversion script is available)
* Experimental: optimize displaying and collisions far from the visible area
* Experimental: sensors are not obstacles anymore when jumping or using the
hookshot, they are activated instead
* Include Mac OS X packaging changes to the git repository
* HUD: the 11th heart was not displayed correctly when incomplete
* Lua: improve the prototype of sol.map.destructible_item_create
* Lua: add a function sol.enemy.get_angle_to_hero()
* Lua: add a function sol.main.get_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
* Allow the ground sprite below the hero to be tileset dependent
* Show a different sprite animation when plunging into lava or water
