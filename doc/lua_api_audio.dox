You can play musics and sound effects through \c sol.audio.

\section lua_api_audio_functions Functions of sol.audio

\subsection lua_api_audio_play_sound sol.audio.play_sound(sound_id)

Plays a sound effect.

Generates a Lua error if the sound does not exist.

Several sounds can be played in parallel.
In the current version, a sound cannot be interrupted after you start
playing it.

Unlike musics, sounds files are entirely read before being played.
A file access is made only the first time you play each sound.
You can use \ref lua_api_audio_preload_sounds if you want to also avoid this
initial file access.
- \c sound_id (string): Name of the sound file to play, relative to the
  \c sounds directory and without extension. Currently, <tt>.ogg</tt> is the
  only extension supported.

\subsection lua_api_audio_preload_sounds sol.audio.preload_sounds()

Loads all sounds effects into memory for faster future access.

If you don't call this function, you can still play sound effects, but the
first access to each sound effect will require a file access that might be
perceptible on slow machines.
It is recommended to call this function at the beginning of the program
(typically from \ref lua_api_main_on_started).

The list of sound files to load is read from the
\ref quest_resource_file "project database" file.

This function does nothing if you already called it before.

\subsection lua_api_audio_play_music sol.audio.play_music(music_id, [action])

Plays a music.

Generates a Lua error if the music does not exist.

Only one music can be played at a time.
If the same music is already playing, it continues normally and does not
restart.
If a different music was already playing, it is stopped and replaced by
the new one.
- \c music_id (string): Name of the music file to play, relative to the
  \c musics directory and without extension. The following extensions will be
  tried in this order: \c <tt>.ogg</tt>, \c <tt>.it</tt> and \c <tt>.spc</tt>.
  \c nil stops playing any music.
  The second parameter has no effect in this case.
  If you set the music name to the same music that is already playing, or to
  the special value \c "same", then this function does nothing.
  The music keeps playing (it does not restart) and the second parameter
  is ignored.
- \c action (function or boolean, optional): What to do when the music
  finishes (reaches its end).
  A boolean value indicates whether or not the music should loop.
  The default is \c true.
  A function value indicates a custom action (and implies no loop).
  It will be called when the music finishes.
  This allows you to perform an action of your choice, like playing
  another music.

\remark Some musics don't have an end.
  This is the case of all <tt>.spc</tt> musics because of their special
  emulation format.
  Some of them simply play forever, other play an empty sound forever after
  some point, but they have no end.
  This can also be the case of some <tt>.it</tt> musics if they
  contain internal loop information to play forever.
  The \c action parameter has no effect on such musics.

\subsection lua_api_audio_get_music sol.audio.get_music()

Returns the name of the music currently playing.

- Return value (string): Name of the music file currently playing, relative to
  the \c musics directory and without extension. Returns \c nil if no music is
  playing.

\subsection lua_api_audio_stop_music sol.audio.stop_music()

Stops playing music.

This function has no effect if no music was playing.

\remark This is equivalent to <tt>sol.audio.play_music("none")</tt>.

\subsection lua_api_audio_get_sound_volume sol.audio.get_sound_volume()

Returns the current volume of sound effects.

This volume applies to all sounds played by \ref lua_api_audio_play_sound
"sol.audio.play_sound()"
and by the engine.
- Return value (number): The current volume of sound effects, as an integer
  between \c 0 (mute) and \c 100 (full volume).

\subsection lua_api_audio_set_sound_volume sol.audio.set_sound_volume(volume)

Sets the volume of sound effects.

This volume applies to all sounds played by \ref lua_api_audio_play_sound
"sol.audio.play_sound()"
and by the engine.
- \c volume (number): The new volume of sound effects, as an integer
  between \c 0 (mute) and \c 100 (full volume).

\subsection lua_api_audio_get_music_volume sol.audio.get_music_volume()

Returns the current volume of musics.

This volume applies to all musics played by \ref lua_api_audio_play_music.
"sol.audio.play_music()"
- Return value (number): The current volume of musics, as an integer
  between \c 0 (no sound effects) and \c 100 (full volume).

\subsection lua_api_audio_set_music_volume sol.audio.set_music_volume(volume)

Sets the volume of musics.

This volume applies to all musics played by \ref lua_api_audio_play_music.
"sol.audio.play_music()"
- \c volume (number): The new volume of musics, as an integer
  between \c 0 (no music) and \c 100 (full volume).

\subsection lua_api_audio_get_music_format sol.audio.get_music_format()

Returns the format of the music currently playing.
- Return value (string): Format of the music: \c "ogg", \c "it" or \c "spc".
  Returns \c nil if no music is playing.

\subsection lua_api_audio_get_music_num_channels sol.audio.get_music_num_channels()

Returns the number of channels of the current .it music.

This function is only supported for .it musics.
- Return value (number): Number of channels of the music.
  Returns \c nil if the current music format is not .it.

\subsection lua_api_audio_get_music_channel_volume sol.audio.get_music_channel_volume(channel)

Returns the volume of notes of a channel for the current .it music.

This function is only supported for .it musics.
- \c channel (number): Index of a channel (the first one is zero).
- Return value (number): Volume of the channel.
  Returns \c nil if the current music format is not .it.

\remark The channel should have the same volume for all its notes.
  Otherwise, calling this function does not make much sense.

\subsection lua_api_audio_set_music_channel_volume sol.audio.set_music_channel_volume(channel, volume)

Sets the volume of all notes of a channel for the current .it music.

This function has no effect for musics other than .it.
- \c channel (number): Index of a channel (the first one is zero).
- \c volume (number): The volume to set.

\subsection lua_api_audio_get_tempo sol.audio.get_tempo()

Returns the tempo of the current .it music.

This function is only supported for .it musics.
- Return value (number): Tempo of the music.
  Returns \c nil if the current music format is not .it.

\subsection lua_api_audio_set_tempo sol.audio.set_tempo(tempo)

Sets the tempo of the current .it music.

This function is only supported for .it musics.
- \c tempo (number): Tempo to set.
