\tableofcontents

A sprite is an animated image.
It is managed by an animation set. The animation set defines
which animations are available and describes, for each animation,
a sequence of images in each direction.

A sprite has the following properties:
- a current animation from its animation set (like \c "walking" or \c "hurt"),
- a current direction that indicates where the sprite is facing,
- a current frame: the index of the current individual image in the sequence.

The animation set of a sprite is composed of one or several PNG images that
store all the frames, and a data file that describes how frames are
organized in the PNG images. The data file also indicates the delay to make
between frames when animating them and other properties like whether the
animation should loop.
See \ref sprite_syntax for more information about the format of sprites.

We describe here the Lua API that you can use to show sprites during your
game or your menus.

\section lua_api_sprite_functions Functions of sol.sprite

\subsection lua_api_sprite_create sol.sprite.create(animation_set_id)

Creates a sprite.
- \c animation_set_id (string): Name of the animation set to use. This name
  must correspond to a valid sprite data file in the \c sprites directory
  (without its extension).
- Return value (sprite): The sprite created, or \c nil if the sprite data file
  could not be loaded.

\section lua_api_sprite_inherited_methods Methods inherited from drawable

Sprites are particular \ref lua_api_drawable "drawable" objects.
Therefore, they inherit all methods from the type drawable.

See \ref lua_api_drawable_methods to know these methods.

\section lua_api_sprite_methods Methods of the type sprite

The following methods are specific to sprites.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_animation sprite:get_animation()

Returns the name of the current animation of this sprite.
- Return value (string): Name of the current animation.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_animation sprite:set_animation()

Sets the current animation of this sprite.
- \c animation_name (string): Name of the animation to set.
  This animation must exist in the animation set.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_direction sprite:get_direction()

Returns the current direction of this sprite.
- Return value (number): The current direction (the first one is \c 0).

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_direction sprite:set_direction(direction)

Sets the current direction of this sprite.
- \c direction (number): The direction to set (the first one is \c 0).
  This direction must exist in the current animation.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_frame sprite:get_frame()

Returns the index of the current frame of this sprite.
- Return value (number): The current frame (the first one is \c 0).

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_frame sprite:set_frame(frame)

Sets the current frame of this sprite.
- \c frame (number): The frame to set (the first one is \c 0).
  This frame must exist in the current direction.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_frame_delay sprite:get_frame_delay()

Returns the delay between two frames of this sprite in the current animation.

This delay is defined by the current animation but may be overriden
by \ref lua_api_sprite_set_frame_delay "set_frame_delay()".
- Return value (number): The delay in milliseconds between two frames in
  the current animation. \c nil means infinite and
  it is only allowed for single-frame animations. 

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_frame_delay sprite:set_frame_delay(delay)

Changes the delay between two frames of this sprite in the current animation.

Use this function if you want to override the normal delay
(the one defined in the sprite data file).
- \c delay (number): The new delay in milliseconds. \c nil means infinite
  and is only allowed for single-frame animations.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_is_paused sprite:is_paused()

Returns whether this sprite is paused.
- Return value (boolean): \c true if this sprite is paused.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_paused sprite:set_paused([paused])

Pauses or resumes the animation of this sprite.
- \c paused (boolean, optional): \c true to pause the sprite,
  \c false to unpause it. No value means \c true.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_ignore_suspend sprite:set_ignore_suspend([ignore])

During a game, sets whether the animation should continue even when the map is
suspended.
- \c ignore (boolean): \c true to continue animation even when the map is
  suspended, \c false otherwise. No value means \c true.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_synchronize sprite:synchronize(reference_sprite)

Synchronizes the frames of this sprite with the frames of a reference sprite.
The synchronization will be performed whenever both animation names match.
The current sprite will no longer apply its normal frame delay: instead, it
will now always set its current frame to the current frame of its reference
sprite.
- \c reference_sprite (sprite, optional): The reference sprite. \c nil means
  stopping any previous synchronization.

\section lua_api_sprite_events Events of the type sprite

Events are callback methods automatically called by the engine if you define
them.

The following events are specific to sprites.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_on_animation_finished sprite:on_animation_finished(animation)

Called when the current animation of this sprite is finished.

If the animation loops, this function is never called.
Unless you start another animation, the sprite is no longer shown.
- \c animation (string): Name of the animation that has just finished.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_on_frame_changed sprite:on_frame_changed(animation, frame)

Called whenever the frame of this sprite has changed.
- \c animation (string): Name of the current animation.
- \c frame (number): The new current frame (the first one is \c 0).
