/**
\page quest_resource_file Resource list

The \c project_db.dat file declares all resources
(maps, musics, sprites, items, enemies, fonts, etc.) of your quest
and their user-friendly names.
Each resource usually corresponds to a data file.

The engine needs this file to preload or initialize some resources when the
program starts.

The quest editor needs this file to provide graphical components that let the
user choose a resource in a list of user-friendly names.
For instance, when the user creates a teletransporter on the map, a graphical
list lets him choose the destination map of the teletransporter.
This list contains the user-friendly name of each map.

We give here the syntax of \c project_db.dat.

\c project_db.dat is a text file encoded in UTF-8.
The sequence of characters \c \-\- (two dashes) marks
the beginning of a comment.
After them, the rest of the line is ignored.
Empty lines are also ignored.

The definition of each resource starts with the name of a resource type
(\c map, \c tileset, \c sound, \c music, \c sprite, \c item, \c enemy
or \c language),
followed by an opening brace, and ends with a closing brace.
Inside the braces, the properties of the resource are specified.
Properties are declared with the syntax <tt>key = value</tt> and
separated with commas. It is allowed to have an extra comma after
the last property. String values are enclosed within double quotes.
Each resource must have the following two properties:
- \c id (string): Id of the element. It should not contain spaces.
  The id determines the data file(s) of this element.
  - For a map: the id is the name of the
    \ref quest_map_data_file "map data file" without its extension,
    relative to the \c maps directory.
    Note that the first map declared in this file will be the default map.
  - For a tileset: the id is the name of the
    \ref quest_tileset_data_file "tileset data file" without its extension,
    relative to the \c tilesets directory.
  - For a sound: the id is the sound file name without its extension,
    relative to the \c sounds directory.
  - For a music: the id is the music file name without its extension,
    relative to the \c musics directory.
  - For a sprite: the id is the name of the
    \ref quest_sprite_data_file "sprite data file",
    relative to the \c sprites directory.
    The sprite data file may be in a hierarchy of subdirectories.
    Subdirectories must be separated by a slash "/" character in the sprite
    id.
  - For an equipment item: the id is the name of the item's Lua script
    without its extension, relative to the \c items directory.
  - For an enemy model: the id is the is name of the enemy's Lua script
    without its extension, relative to the \c enemies directory.
  - For a language: the id is the name of a subdirectory of the \c languages
    directory.
  - For a font: the id is the font file name without its extension,
    relative to the \c fonts directory.
- \c description (string): A human-readable name that describes this element.
  It may contain spaces. It is useful to show to userse something more
  user-friendly than the id.

Example of a quest resource list file:

\verbatim
map{      id = "outside",      description = "Outside World" }
map{      id = "hero_house",   description = "House of the hero" }
map{      id = "shop",         description = "Shop" }
map{      id = "dungeon_1_1f", description = "Dungeon 1 - First floor" }
map{      id = "dungeon_1_2f", description = "Dungeon 1 - Second floor" }

tileset{  id = "overworld",    description = "Overworld" }
tileset{  id = "house",        description = "House" }
tileset{  id = "dungeon",      description = "Dungeon" }

sound{    id = "door_closed",  description = "Door closing" }
sound{    id = "door_open",    description = "Door opening" }
sound{    id = "enemy_hurt",   description = "Enemy hurt" }
sound{    id = "jump",         description = "Jumping" }
sound{    id = "treasure",     description = "Treasure" }

item{     id = "sword",        description = "Sword" }
item{     id = "bow",          description = "Bow" }
item{     id = "arrow",        description = "Arrows (x1 / x5 / x10)" }

enemy{    id = "soldier",      description = "Soldier" }
enemy{    id = "dragon",       description = "Dragon" }

language{ id = "en",           description = "English" }

font{     id = "8_bit",        description = "8 bit font" }
\endverbatim

In the quest editor, you can add, remove and change the id and the description
of resources from the quest tree.
Therefore, you probably don't need to edit this file by hand.

\remark The syntax of this resource list file is actually valid Lua.
  The engine internally uses Lua to parse it.
