# This file describes each item of the quest.
# It determines the equipment, the treasures and the pickable items.
# Each group defines an item, and its title is the name identifying the item.
# The following variables are recognized inside the group.
#
# - savegame_variable (integer)
#   If set, the item possession state will be saved in the variable specified.
#   The possession state corresponds to the variant of the item that the player
#   has. It is represented as an integer: 0 if the player has not the item,
#   1 if he has the first variant, etc.
#   If you specify nothing, the item is not saved.
#
# - nb_variants (integer)
#   Number of variants of the item. If the item is saved, then its possession
#   state is equal to 0 if the player has not the item, or a number between 1
#   and nb_variant if he has a variant of the item.
#   The default value is 1.
#
# - initial_variant (integer)
#   Initial possession state of the item (only for items saved). The default
#   value is 0.
#
# - can_be_assigned (boolean)
#   If true, the item can be assigned to an item key from the inventory subscreen
#   and then be used explicitely by pressing this item key.
#   Then the possession state of the item must be saved (i.e. savegame_variable must be set).
#   The default value is false.
#
# - counter (integer)
#   If a counter should be associated to the item, you can indicate here in which
#   savegame variable this counter will be saved.
#   The maximum value of the counter must be defined by limit or limit_for_counter
#   (see below).
#
# - limit (integer)
#   Maximum value of the counter associated to this item.
#
# - limit_for_counter (string)
#   When this item is obtained, the maximum value of the counter of another item
#   (whose id is specified here) is set to a new maximum.
#   The current value is also set to this maximum.
#   The special counters "money", "life" and "magic" are also accepted.
#
# - changes_counter (string)
#   When this item is obtained, the counter of another item (whose id is specified here)
#   is increased to an amount.
#   The special counters "money", "life", "magic" and "small_keys" are also accepted.
#
# - amount (integer)
#   Indicates the amount to increase when changes_counter is defined, or the maximum amount to set
#   when limits_counter is defined. The default value is 1.
#   
# - amount_1, amount_2, …, amount_n (integers)
#   Same as amount, but with different amounts depending on what variant of the item
#   is obtained. n is the number of variants.
#
# - probability (integer)
#   Some items are generated randomly, for example the pickable treasures dropped by enemies.
#   If this value is defined, then the item can be generated randomly and with the probability specified.
#   The probability is an integer between 0 and 1000. The sum of probabilities
#   of all items should be lower than 1000. The remaining probability corresponds to
#   the case where no item is genereated.
#
# - probability_1, probability_2, …, probability_n (integers)
#   Same as probability, but with different probabilities for the different variants of the item.
#   n is the number of variants.
#   
# - shadow (string)
#   Defines the size of the shadow displayed under the item when it is placed on the ground
#   (for example as a pickable trasure dropped by an enemy). The possible values are
#   none, small or big. The default value is big.
#
# - can_disappear (boolean)
#   When the item is picked up on the ground by the hero (i.e. represented as
#   a pickable treasure), this variable indicates whether the item should disappear
#   after a few seconds. The default value is false.
#
# - brandish_when_picked (boolean)
#   When the item is picked up on the ground by the hero (i.e. represented as
#   a pickable treasure), this variable indicates whether the hero should brandish
#   the item (like an item found in a chest). The default value is true.
#
# - sound_when_picked (string)
#   When the item is picked up on the ground by the hero (i.e. represented as
#   a pickable treasure), this variable indicates what sound is played.
#   The default value is picked_item.
#
# - sound_when_brandished (string)
#   This variable indicates what sound is played when the item is brandished by the
#   player. The default value is treasure.
